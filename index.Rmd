# Methods

The Poudre River at Lincoln Bridge is:

  - Downstream of only a little bit of urban stormwater

  - Near Odell Brewing CO
  
  - Near an open space area and the Poudre River Trail
  
  - Downstream of many agricultral diversions

## Data Acquisition and Plotting tests

## Data Download


```{r downloader}

q <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '06752260',
                parameterCd = '00060',
                startDate = '2017-01-01',
                endDate = '2022-01-01') %>%
  rename(q = 'X_00060_00003')


```



## Static Data Plotter


```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}

ggplot(q, aes(x = Date, y = q)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab('Q (cfs)') + 
  ggtitle('Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins')

```


## Interactive Data Plotter


```{r}

q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)


dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)")
```



# Assignment. 


## DyGraph example. 

```{r}

q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)


dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") %>%
  dyOptions(drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 2)

```

## Poudre Paragraph

The Poudre river planform, *straightened meander*, has been artificially produced **through years of human manipulation** to the [hydrograph](https://www.ajsonline.org/content/ajs/255/3/161.full.pdf). Historically the Poudre, especially at lower elevations exhibited a complex, dynamic braided planform due to the relative high [snowmelt](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/2937055) peaks, regular convective storm inputs, and heavy sediment loads that encourage island building. Due to mass irrigation, diversions, and groundwater drawdowns sediment and **flow dynamics have shifted so drastically** that the Poudre now has insufficient stream power to maintain this [planform](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=aYsJyFAnqeAC&oi=fnd&pg=PA131&dq=Wohl+Egenhoff+Great+Plains&ots=t9rnQyFvN2&sig=sGyXwh6r0-jm4NjIOjXLMfSFY9Q#v=onepage&q=Wohl%20Egenhoff%20Great%20Plains&f=false). Now the river is relatively simplified, the bed has become more armored, and the floodplain has become more disconnected over time causing drastics impacts to the riparian and aquatic communities.
